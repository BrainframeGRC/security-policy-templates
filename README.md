# security-policy-templates

This repository is maintained by [Brainframe GRC](https://www.brainframe.com) and serves as a curated collection of modular policy and procedure templates. These templates form the backbone of a standardized and efficient information security management system for cloud-native organizations.

> ðŸ§  **Note:** This project is a fork of the original [security-policy-templates](https://github.com/JupiterOne/security-policy-templates) developed by [JupiterOne](https://github.com/JupiterOne/security-policy-templates/blob/main/CODEOWNERS), with major structural and content changes made by Brainframe GRC to support broader governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) use cases.

## Purpose

This repository now functions solely as a **template bucket**. The prior CLI build tools and policy builder logic have been removed.

As part of the **Brainframe GRC platform**, these templates are fully mapped to **over 80 compliance and security frameworks**, enabling easy control and policy alignment across SOC 2, ISO 27001, NIST, HIPAA, CIS, and more.
