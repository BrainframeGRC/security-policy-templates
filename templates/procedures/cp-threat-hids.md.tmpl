### Host Intrusion Detection

Host based intrusion detection is supported via one of the following:

* On Windows and macOS systems: **{{xdrProvider}}** agents for malware
  detection and behavior-based endpoint threat detection.

* On Linux servers: **{{xdrProvider}}** agents for activity monitoring,
  vulnerability scanning, and threat detection.  This includes all virtual
  instances running in the cloud environment.
