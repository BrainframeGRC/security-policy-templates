### Production System Monitoring and Paging

Software and systems deployed in production are monitored 24/7 for health check
and other major/critical error conditions. The on call team is paged via
{{siemProvider}} in the event an error or failure is detected.

Notifications via additional channels such as {{internalChatProvider}} and email are also
configured.
