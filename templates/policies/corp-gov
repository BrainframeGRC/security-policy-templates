# Corporate Governance Policy

{{companyShortName}} is committed to **transparent and ethical business practices**, ensuring the protection of the long-term interests of its employees, customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.

To uphold these principles, **the CEO, supported by the Board of Directors (BoD) where applicable**, ensures that:

- **Corporate bylaws and governance frameworks** are established, clearly defining the responsibilities of leadership.  
- The **CEO, and where applicable, the BoD**, identifies and fulfills oversight responsibilities in accordance with regulatory requirements and organizational expectations.  
- The **CEO, and where applicable, members of the BoD**, are periodically evaluated to ensure they possess the necessary skills and expertise to lead the organization effectively and take appropriate actions.  
- If a **BoD is in place**, it includes independent members who provide objective evaluations and decision-making.  
- The **roles, responsibilities, and expectations of leadership** (whether through the CEO alone or supported by the BoD) are clearly defined and communicated across the organization, including to service providers and business partners.  

This approach ensures effective corporate governance, whether **led solely by the CEO or supported by a formal board structure**, aligning with industry best practices and regulatory requirements.
