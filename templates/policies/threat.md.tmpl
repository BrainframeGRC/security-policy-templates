# Threat Detection and Prevention Policy

## 1. Purpose  

The purpose of this policy is to define how {{companyShortName}} detects, monitors, and mitigates security threats across its cloud-based infrastructure. Given our reliance on managed networks and cloud environments, this policy focuses on lightweight yet effective security measures tailored to our operational model.  

This policy complements and operates in conjunction with related policies, including but not limited to:  
- **Information Security Policy** – overarching security framework  
- **Incident Response Policy** – handling security incidents  
- **Vulnerability Management Policy** – proactive risk mitigation  
- **Access Policy** – controlling user and system access  
- **System Audits, Monitoring, and Assessments Policy** – ensuring ongoing security oversight  
- **Risk Management Policy** – addressing and mitigating security risks  

## 2. Scope  

This policy applies to all cloud-based systems, applications, and endpoints within {{companyShortName}}, including third-party services that process or store company data. Given the nature of the company operating in shared or managed office spaces, reliance on a secure cloud infrastructure is prioritized over on-premise network defences.

## 3. Policy Statements  

### 3.1. Threat Detection and Monitoring  
- All cloud environments must have built-in security monitoring enabled (e.g., AWS GuardDuty, Azure Security Center, Google Security Command Center).  
- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) solutions must be used to monitor workstations and cloud workloads for suspicious activity.  
- Logs from critical systems must be collected and monitored for signs of unauthorized access or anomalous behaviour.  
- Threat intelligence sources should be leveraged to stay informed about emerging security risks.  

### 3.2. Threat Prevention and Response  
- Security misconfigurations must be identified and remediated as part of continuous security monitoring.  
- Automated security controls, such as firewall rules, access restrictions, and anomaly detection, should be enabled where applicable.  
- Any detected security threats must be escalated according to the **Incident Response Policy**.  
- Employees must be trained to recognize and report security threats as outlined in the **Roles, Responsibilities, and Training Policy**.  

### 3.3. Access Control and Identity Security  
- User access should follow the principle of least privilege, as defined in the **Access Policy**.  
- Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) must be enforced for all cloud-based services where available.  
- Automated monitoring should be enabled to detect unauthorized access attempts or unusual login activity.  

### 3.4. Continuous Improvement  
- Regular security assessments and internal reviews must be conducted in accordance with the **System Audits and Monitoring Policy**.  
- Threat detection capabilities should be reviewed periodically to align with evolving risks.  

## 4. Compliance and Review  
This policy will be reviewed annually or as needed to ensure alignment with evolving security threats and business needs. Updates will be made in coordination with the **Policy Management** process.
